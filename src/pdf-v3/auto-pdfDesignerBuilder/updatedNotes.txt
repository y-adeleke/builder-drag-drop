-heading is still being jumped. 
exmaple:
here is the start of my 3rd section which coincedattly began in a new page:
        {
            "id": 3,
            "level": 2,
            "heading": {
                "type": "heading",
                "text": "Tariff developments",
                "level": 2,
                "style": {}
            },
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "paragraph",
                    "text": "As we will discuss, tariff news has been trending somewhat positively, including a China detente and a U.S.-UK trade deal. In turn, news sentiment in the U.S. has become somewhat less negative (see next chart).",
                    "style": {
                        "text-align": "left"
                    }
                }
            ],
            "subsections": [
                {
                    "level": 3,
                    "heading": {
                        "type": "heading",
                        "text": "Daily news sentiment in the U.S. has improved",
                        "level": 3,
                        "style": {}
                    },
                    "content": [
                        {
                            "type": "image",
                            "src": "https://www.rbcgam.com/dA/c44e184c1f380b93de9d14e80bcf0fc1",
                            "alt": "Daily news sentiment in the US has improved",
                            "style": {}
                        },
yet it wrnt into my subsections and place this header:
  {
                    "level": 3,
                    "heading": {
                        "type": "heading",
                        "text": "Global trade policy uncertainty has fallen but remains high",
                        "level": 3,
                        "style": {}
                    },

so my first column started with:
Global trade policy uncertainty has fallen but remains high -my subsection heade
Tariff developments - actual section header
As we will discuss, tariff news has been trending somewhat positively, including a China detente and a U.S.-UK trade deal. In turn, news sentiment in the U.S. has become somewhat less negative (see next chart).


2. Although a lot of the pages respected the padding, there was an instace where i turned on the header in pages and there was page where the content overflow the first column and was cut off. there was no repect for the padding bottom. in most cases, it worked well though. 


3. I noticed a lot of empty pages and the end of the pages...it was just blank why was this created? 


4. what is the logic about the first page below cover, when do we jump to create the second page?

4. in some contents that are not so large, 
forst page bseide profile was complety empty,
it started the content on second page 
then alot of white spaces in each page 

it created 16 pages for the contents below:

Progress is being made on several fronts, though, and peak fear related to tariffs is now likely behind. The U.S. has struck trade deals with the U.K. and China, and reciprocal tariffs have been delayed at least until July/August. That said, some level of tariffs remain in place and the ultimate impact on the economy from increased taxation on global trade remains to be seen. So far, confidence of businesses and consumers has taken a hit, but actual economic data has been resilient and leading indicators continue to point to modest growth (exhibits 1 and 2). Overall, we look for slow but positive economic growth in 2025 and recognize that the odds of recession, though not trivial, have diminished due to Trump’s willingness to dial back extreme tariff threats. Looking further ahead, we expect growth to accelerate a bit into 2026 as tariff uncertainty ultimately diminishes and fiscal stimulus offers support.",

The timing and magnitude of the drop suggests investors may be questioning U.S. exceptionalism and the safe-haven status of the U.S. dollar. Given that the currency remains extremely overvalued, even after this recent drop, we believe that much more weakness still lies ahead. For global investors, these currency moves are critical in comparing assets on a common currency basis, where the dollar’s decline has been a drag on U.S. stock and bond performance so far this year relative to international assets.",

In the U.S., the Fed has been on pause so far this year since the labour market is healthy and inflation remains slightly above the 2.0% target. Progress on inflation coming down could be temporarily delayed until 2026 due to tariffs, though it is important for the Fed to not overreact to heightened inflation pressure in the near-term given that any price-boost from tariffs is unlikely to be repeated. We expect that slowing growth will nudge the Fed to deliver three 25-basis-point cuts over the next year, in line with what the market has priced in (Exhibit 4), and we recognize that, should the economy weaken further, the Fed has ample capacity to lower interest rates from the currently restrictive stance.

The S&P 500 fell just shy of a bear market with a 19% peak-to-trough decline, while international equity markets outperformed especially when factoring in recent U.S. dollar weakness (Exhibit 6). Following Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause to reciprocal tariffs, though, stocks enjoyed a powerful rally, further boosted by the trade deal with China. As a result, most major indices fully erased their prior losses and many non-U.S. markets climbed to new records. The latest rally did push U.S. large-cap stocks back to expensive territory, limiting their return potential. But our models suggest that global stocks, in aggregate, are not expensive and that equity markets outside North America are trading at attractive distances below their fair value (Exhibit 7).",

Analysts look for 8.5% profit growth in 2025 followed by 13.5% growth in 2026. Should the S&P 500 trade between 0.5 standard deviations to a full standard deviation above equilibrium, it can deliver low single-digit to high single-digit annualized returns through the end of 2026 if the consensus earnings estimates are achieved (Exhibit 8). That said, earnings growth could face headwinds, particularly if profit margins weaken due to tariffs and re-shoring production to the U.S., which could increase input costs and reduce operating efficiencies. Should profits fail to meet expectations, U.S. stocks would be vulnerable given the starting point of elevated valuations and heightened investor enthusiasm.",

In our base case scenario, the economy will continue growing at a sluggish pace against a backdrop of modest inflation, allowing for some further central-bank easing. In this environment, we expect sovereign bonds to deliver mid-single-digit returns over the year ahead as long as inflation continues falling toward central bankers’ targets, with the possibility of higher returns should the economy encounter a meaningful slowdown. Although stocks have already enjoyed an impressive recovery, we continue to expect stocks to outperform bonds. Furthermore, the equity-market sell off in March/April generated extremely oversold conditions that have historically been consistent with durable market bottoms. As a result, we added 1% to our equity allocation during the quarter, sourced from cash, favouring regions outside the U.S. where valuations are relatively more appealing. Our current recommended asset mix for a global balanced investor is 61.0% equities (strategic: “neutral”: 60%), 38.0% bonds (strategic “neutral”: 38%) and 1.0% in cash (Exhibit 9).",

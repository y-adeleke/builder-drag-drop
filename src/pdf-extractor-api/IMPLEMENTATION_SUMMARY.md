# Section Grouping Algorithm - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented and improved section-grouping and subsection-grouping algorithms for the website extraction API. The algorithms now properly handle hierarchical content organization with robust edge case handling.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed Heading Duplication ✅

**Problem**: Headings were appearing in both the section's `heading` property and `content` array.
**Solution**: Modified algorithm to only store headings in the `heading` property, keeping `content` array clean.

### 2. Simplified Section Grouping Logic ✅

**Problem**: Complex fallback logic was creating separate sections for subsection-level headings.
**Solution**: Implemented simpler, more predictable logic:

- Same or higher level headings (≤ current level) create new sections
- Lower level headings (> current level) are added to current section content
- Subsection organization is handled in the separate `createSubsections` function

### 3. Enhanced Subsection Creation ✅

**Problem**: Original algorithm only handled minimum deeper level, missing intermediate levels.
**Solution**: Improved algorithm that:

- Finds the next logical subsection level (smallest deeper level)
- Properly separates main section content from subsection content
- Supports recursive nesting with depth limits to prevent infinite loops

### 4. Added Infinite Recursion Protection ✅

**Problem**: Recursive subsection creation could theoretically cause infinite loops.
**Solution**: Added depth limiting (max 3 levels) with proper termination conditions.

## Algorithm Flow

### Section Grouping (`groupContentIntoSections`)

1. **Intro Section**: If content doesn't start with heading, create intro section with `level: null`
2. **Section Creation**:
   - Higher/same level headings → new section
   - Lower level headings → add to current section (for later subsection processing)
3. **Content Addition**: Non-heading content always goes to current section

### Subsection Creation (`createSubsections`)

1. **Level Analysis**: Find all deeper heading levels in section content
2. **Subsection Level**: Use the minimum (closest) deeper level for subsections
3. **Content Separation**:
   - Content before first subsection heading → main section content
   - Content after subsection headings → respective subsections
4. **Recursive Processing**: Apply subsection logic recursively (with depth limit)

## Test Results

### Edge Cases Successfully Handled:

- ✅ Empty content
- ✅ Content without headings (intro sections)
- ✅ Non-sequential heading levels (H1→H3→H2)
- ✅ Deep nesting (H1→H2→H3→H4→H5→H6)
- ✅ Level gaps and orphaned headings
- ✅ Complex real-world document structures
- ✅ Empty sections (detected and flagged)
- ✅ Multiple subsection levels

### Performance Characteristics:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²) in worst case (due to recursive processing)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for section hierarchy
- **Depth Limit**: 3 levels of nesting (configurable)
- **Robustness**: No infinite loops, graceful handling of malformed structures

## API Response Structure

```javascript
{
  title: "Article Title",
  backgroundImg: "hero-image-url",
  date: "Article Date",
  sections: [
    {
      id: 1,
      level: null, // or heading level (1-6)
      heading: { type: "heading", text: "Section Title", level: 2 },
      content: [/* non-heading content blocks */],
      subsections: [
        {
          level: 3,
          heading: { type: "heading", text: "Subsection Title", level: 3 },
          content: [/* subsection content */],
          subsections: [/* nested subsections if any */]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Empty Sections**: Algorithm correctly identifies them but doesn't automatically remove them (by design, for transparency)
2. **Very Deep Nesting** (>3 levels): Limited by depth parameter, deeper headings remain in content arrays
3. **Non-standard Heading Patterns**: Algorithm handles most cases gracefully but very unusual patterns might need custom handling

The implementation is now robust, handles all identified edge cases, and provides a clean hierarchical structure suitable for document rendering and navigation.
